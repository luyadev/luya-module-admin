## from 2.1 to 2.1

+ The {{luya\admin\Module::$apiUserAllowActionsWithoutPermissions}} disables the access for **none permission protected actions** by default. This means that actions which does not have a permission system entry (like the global search) are disabled unless `$apiUserAllowActionsWithoutPermissions` is enabled. This ensures the Api Users which can be used for SPA applications won't have access to system APIs.

## from 1.2 to 2.0
